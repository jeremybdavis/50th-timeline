                    <p>At HCA, we are driven to help clinicians discover and deliver predictive, precise, and personalized medicine for their patients. In 2013, HCA’s comprehensive infection prevention study, (REDUCE) MRSA, showed a 44 percent decrease in bloodstream infections in ICU patients. Another example of groundbreaking clinical research, which set the standard for care, is when HCA implemented a special screening of newborns to prevent brain damage (kernicterus) caused by severe jaundice.</p>
